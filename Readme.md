## Game Mechanics

1. **Speed Increment**
   - The speed of the player's car increases by 1 after every 5 seconds.
   - The starting speed is always set to 5.

2. **Score Increment**
   - The score is incremented by 10 points only when the rear end of the player's car (yellow) has completely passed the rear end of an enemy car (green).
   - The score should not increase in any other scenario.
